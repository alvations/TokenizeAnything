Template:Shortcut Administrators , also called sysops , are active and regular Wikipedians who have access to technical features that help with maintenance . Administrators are expected to respect and be familiar with Wikipedia policy as they are known and trusted members of the community . They can protect and delete pages , block other editors , and undo these actions as well . By default , these privileges are granted indefinitely and are only removed under exceptional circumstances involving high level intervention ( see Administrator abuse below ) .

In the very early days of Wikipedia , all users functioned as administrators , and in principle they still should . Any user can behave in a way befitting an administrator ( provided they do not falsely claim to be one ) , even if they have not been given the extra administrative functions . From early on , it has been pointed out that administrators should never develop into a special subgroup of the community but should be a part of the community like anyone else . However , they are equipped with a few more tools to do some chores that would potentially be harmful if everyone were entrusted with them . Over time , standards to getting appointed administrator have risen , but there are still several administrators created every week .

The community does look to administrators to perform essential housekeeping chores that require the extra access administrators are entrusted with . Among them are watching the Articles for deletion debates and carrying out the consensus of the community on keeping or deleting these articles , keeping an eye on new and changed articles to swiftly delete obvious vandalism , and meeting user requests for help that require administrative access . Since administrators are expected to be experienced members of the community , users seeking help will often turn to an administrator for advice and information . In general , administrators acting in this role are neutral . They do not have any direct involvement in the issues they are helping people with .
